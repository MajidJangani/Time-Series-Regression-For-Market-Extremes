# Predicting Intraday Price Ranges for GLD

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a trading strategy that predicts the market price range for a single trading day. The aim is to forecast potential upward and downward deviations from the market's opening price within the same session. While achieving high predictive accuracy is not the primary goal, this project emphasizes the application of quantitative modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze intraday price movements and provide actionable insights for traders.

## Objectives
- **Forecast intraday price deviations**: Predict potential high and low price ranges from the market's opening price.
- **Leverage quantitative techniques**: Apply advanced modeling and machine learning methods for financial data analysis.
- **Enhance interpretability**: Ensure the results are clear and actionable for traders.

## Why SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD)?
The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) is chosen as the asset of interest due to its:
- **Accessibility**: GLD provides a straightforward way to gain exposure to gold price movements without trading futures or handling physical gold.
- **Liquidity**: As a widely traded asset, GLD mirrors gold price dynamics closely, offering a reliable dataset for analysis.

By focusing on GLD, the project aligns with the broader objective of forecasting price deviations within a highly liquid and accessible market.

## Methodology
1. **Data Sourcing**: Obtain historical price data for GLD to analyze intraday movements.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and structure the data for effective modeling.
3. **Modeling**: Apply machine learning and statistical techniques to predict high and low deviations from the opening price.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance and interpret results to provide meaningful insights for traders.
